# RNA-seq-data-analysis-DEMO
## Introduction
A hands-on work of RNA-seq data analysis for mining resistance-related genes in agriculture pests is presented. The purpose is to explore potential genes related to acaricide resistance in "Tetranychus urticae" using RNA-seq data and bioinformatic methods. The design of RNA-seq data contains 3 treatments, including "With exposure", "Without exposure" and "Reference". The procedure of analysis consist of 5 steps: (1) Quality control, (2) Genome indexing, (3) Read counts calculation (4) Diffential expressed genes (DEGs), and (5) Enrichment analysis.
